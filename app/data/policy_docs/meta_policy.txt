Meta Community Standards: Hate Speech and Harmful Content

Overview
Meta prohibits hate speech, defined as a direct attack against people on the basis of protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, and serious disease.

Definitions
- Direct attacks include violent or dehumanizing speech, harmful stereotypes, statements of inferiority, expressions of contempt, disgust or dismissal, cursing, and calls for exclusion or segregation.
- Tier 1 violations include dehumanizing comparisons, mocking victims of hate crimes, and advocating for violence.
- Tier 2 violations include generalizations about inferiority and statements of contempt.
- Tier 3 violations include exclusionary statements and calls for segregation.

Exceptions
We allow content discussing hate speech for educational or awareness purposes. Satire and humor related to hate speech may be allowed if it doesn't reinforce stereotypes or directly attack protected groups.

Content Removal Guidelines
- Content that explicitly advocates for violence based on protected characteristics will be removed immediately.
- Dehumanizing comparisons between protected groups and animals, insects, pests, disease, or criminals will be removed.
- Claims that protected groups are inherently inferior, deficient, or undesirable will be removed.

Enforcement Actions
- First violation: Warning and content removal
- Second violation: Temporary restriction (24 hours)
- Third violation: Temporary restriction (3-7 days)
- Repeated violations: Account review which may lead to permanent suspension
- Severe violations: Immediate and permanent account suspension
