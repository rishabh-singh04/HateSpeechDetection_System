Indian Penal Code Provisions on Hate Speech

Overview
India addresses hate speech through various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and related legal provisions to maintain public order, prevent communal disharmony, and protect citizens' dignity.

Relevant Sections
- **Section 153A**: Promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, language, or caste. Punishable with up to 3 years imprisonment and/or fine.
- **Section 295A**: Deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings. Punishable with up to 3 years imprisonment and/or fine.
- **Section 505(1)**: Publishing or circulating statements with intent to incite hatred or alarm among the public. Covers rumor-mongering that leads to fear or violence.
- **IT Act Section 66A** (struck down but relevant historically): Criminalized offensive electronic communication.

Definition of Hate Speech
There is no single definition, but courts recognize hate speech as any expression that promotes hatred against a protected group and could disturb public peace.

Judicial Principles
- Intent, tone, and impact matter more than literal words.
- Truth is not always a defense if the speech is inflammatory.
- Satire or parody is not protected if it incites harm.

Enforcement
- FIR can be registered based on complaint.
- Courts can order take-downs or injunctions.
- Police may issue preventive notices under CrPC.

Examples of Punishable Acts
- Making inflammatory speeches during election campaigns
- Posting communal memes or misinformation
- Threats based on caste or religion

Policy Notes
The Supreme Court has emphasized restraint in using these laws and the need to protect free speech unless there's real incitement to violence.
